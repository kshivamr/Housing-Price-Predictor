🏡 Housing Prices Prediction - Regression Problem
This project is a machine learning model designed to predict housing prices using the Kaggle Housing Price Predictor dataset. The entire analysis and model development were conducted in a Google Colab notebook, making it easy to replicate and run without any local setup. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the end-to-end process of building a predictive model, from data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model training, evaluation, and comparison of multiple algorithms.

🌟 Key Features
The project includes comprehensive data preprocessing that handles missing values, performs feature engineering, and encodes categorical variables. Detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) provides visual insights into the relationships between features and housing prices. Three supervised learning models—Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor—were trained and evaluated to predict housing prices. Model performance is measured using standard metrics such as R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE). The notebook is interactive, self-contained, and fully commented, enabling users to follow each step of the workflow.

🛠️ Getting Started (Google Colab)
The easiest way to start is by opening the notebook directly in Google Colab. No local installation is required. Once opened, go to Runtime → Run all to execute all cells. The notebook will automatically install necessary libraries and run the full analysis.

📊 Dataset & Problem Statement
The project uses the Kaggle Housing Price Predictor dataset, which is a standard regression dataset containing features like square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and other property details. The goal is to predict the final sale price of houses based on these features.

🤖 Methodology
The project follows a standard machine learning workflow: loading the dataset from Kaggle, cleaning and preprocessing the data, performing feature engineering to enhance model performance, training three models (Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor), and evaluating their performance using R-squared and MSE metrics.

🚀 Results
The models were compared to select the best-performing one. The results include R-squared scores and MSE values for each model, highlighting their ability to explain variance and predict housing prices accurately.

📚 Dependencies
The project relies on the following Python libraries, which are pre-installed in Google Colab: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn.
